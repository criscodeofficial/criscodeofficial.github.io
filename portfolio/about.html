                <p>I always give my best effort to build a beautiful, attractive, and responsive frontend websites using HTML, CSSS,
                    SASS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

                <p>As I gain experience in building websites in frontend, I built an ecommerce website with native PHP as my backend language.</p>
                <p>As I go beyond, I developed and designed an ecommerce website using Laravel Framework and it's very
                    comfortable to use. 
                </p>
                <p>To have better understanding in Laravel and Vue JS Framework, I created Covid-19 Assessment which is a single page application (SPA).
